# hello-world
My initial foray into the world of GitHub

Hi! I'm Stuart Kearns aka zombiesnack. My background is in urban transportation planning, but I've always been interested in coding. I've picked up a few languages over the years (C++, Python, JavaScript & a little Java). At 50, I'm too old to go back to college, and certifications seem worthless to me without a good portfolio of code to back them up. So here I am starting to build up a portfolio.
